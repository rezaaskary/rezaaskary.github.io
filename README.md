## About Me

I am a Senior Data Scientist with over **3.5 years of industry experience** and **5+ years of academic training**, specializing in **machine learning**, **probabilistic modeling**, **time-series forecasting**, and **sensor-based systems**. My work spans research and production in regulated and real-time settings, especially in the context of diabetes technology and medical devices.

I design and build **large-scale ML systems**, from algorithm development to cloud-native deployment (AWS, GCP, Databricks). I also work on **agentic AI workflows**, reinforcement-learning-style systems, and RAG pipelines.

## Experience

### Senior Data Scientist — Novo Nordisk  
*Boston, MA* — June 2023 to October 2025  
- Built a **multi-agent RAG system** (LangChain + LangGraph, V-model aligned) for FDA-regulated document workflows.  
- Developed a scalable **Databricks pipeline** integrating 25+ clinical trials (~17,000 participants).  
- Fine-tuned a **1.5B-parameter LLM** (DeepSeek distilled) for insulin-dosing assistive agents.  
- Designed a **RAG-based labeling system** for clinical trial data.  
- Implemented **hierarchical Bayesian inference** to optimize a SaMD insulin-dosing algorithm.

### Corporate Research Scientist — Novo Nordisk  
*Seattle, WA* — August 2021 to August 2022  
- Led the probabilistic optimization pipeline for a **Human Digital Twin** platform, achieving ~60× speedup in vectorized simulation.  
- Built multi-scale **in silico PK/PD models** for insulin candidate evaluation.

### Graduate Research Assistant — Illinois Institute of Technology  
*Chicago, IL* — August 2018 to April 2023  
- Developed deep learning models for **activity detection** from biosensor data (Empatica E4).  
- Designed an **MPC-based insulin control algorithm** using continuous glucose monitor (CGM) data plus wearable sensors.
